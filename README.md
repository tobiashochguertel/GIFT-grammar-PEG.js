# GIFT-grammar-PEG.js
Development of PEG grammar to parse [GIFT (quiz question) file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIFT_(file_format)). The goal is to find an intuitive and fun way to create quiz questions.

Initial hacking done using https://pegjs.org/online. The GIFT.pegjs file goes on the left and the test GIFT goes on the right. Note that nothing is saved in this environment (you must copy-paste back to your own files).

# Demo (under development)

- [Demo](https://tobiashochguertel.github.io/GIFT-grammar-PEG.js/editor/index.html)

## Automated regression tests

There are [dynamically generated tests using Mocha](https://mochajs.org/#dynamically-generating-tests) from sample GIFT/JSON files in `./test/questions/`. 

To be able to run the tests, you must set up your environment:
 - [Install node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
 - Clone this repo.
 - Install the node.js dependencies for this project. Inside the root directory of this repo, type: 

        npm install .

 - Run the regression tests with the following command: 
 
        npm test
 - Output will look something like this:
 
 		$ npm test

		> gift-grammar-pegjs@1.0.0 test C:\Users\fuhrm\Documents\GitHub\GIFT-grammar-PEG.js
		> mocha tests --recursive

 - To create a new test GIFT file, just name it `foo.gift` in `./test/questions/`. The JSON file `foo.json` should exist (expected output) and can be easily generated from the output at https://pegjs.org/online. Note: any `undefined` values from that output must be declared as `null` in the JSON file.

## GIFT format

*General Import Format Technology* (GIFT) is described at several places, but it's hard to know what the definitive source is.

This table is not sufficient to understand everything. Please see https://docs.moodle.org/en/GIFT_format and http://buypct.com/gift_reference.pdf for many more details.

| Symbols	| Use |
| :------- | :----- |
| // text	| Comment until end of line (optional) | 
|  ::title::	| Question title (optional) | 
| text	| Question text (becomes title if no title specified)| 
| [...format...]	| The format of the following bit of text. Options are [html], [moodle], [plain] and [markdown]. The default is [moodle] for the question text, other parts of the question default to the format used for the question text. | 
| {	| Start answer(s) -- without any answers, text is a description of following questions | 
| {T} or {F}	|  True or False answer; also {TRUE} and {FALSE} | 
| { ... =right ... }	| Correct answer for multiple choice, (multiple answer? -- see page comments) or fill-in-the-blank| 
| { ... ~wrong ... }	| Incorrect answer for multiple choice or multiple answer| 
| { ... =item -> match ... }	| Answer for matching questions| 
| #feedback text	| Answer feedback for preceding multiple, fill-in-the-blank, or numeric answers| 
| ####general feedback	| General feedback| 
| {#	| Start numeric answer(s)| 
| answer:tolerance	| Numeric answer accepted within ± tolerance range| 
| low..high	| Lower and upper range values of accepted numeric answer| 
| =%n%answer:tolerance	| n percent credit for one of multiple numeric ranges within tolerance from answer| 
| }	| End answer(s)| 
| \character	| Backslash escapes the special meaning of ~, =, #, {, }, and :| 
| \n	| Places a newline in question text -- blank lines delimit questions|

## Class model for Moodle questions (quiz) format

The following UML diagram is an interpretation of the XML format for Moodle quiz import/export (the XML format is naive and can't easily be schema-tized). This interpretation aims to facilitate the understanding of the content and relations. It's a hybrid domain and data model.
